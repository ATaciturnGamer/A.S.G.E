# A.S.G.E: AsciiShips Game Engine (W.I.P)

A simple Ascii-graphics game engine that runs games off the terminal

The initial idea was to create a Battleships game (AsciiShips) with Ascii Graphics.
Then it sort of took off from there.


### Current Progress:

<ul>
  <li>Game Loop</li>
  <li>Input System (Mouse works only on some terminals)</li>
  <li>AscWindow System (For implementing GUIs)</li>
  <li>Scene System</li>
  <li>Ascii Render System (With Z axis sorting)</li>
</ul>

I don't really know what more to add

### TODO:

<ul>
  <li>Make Battleships!</li>
</ul>
