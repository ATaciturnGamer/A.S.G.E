# A.S.G.E: AsciiShips Game Engine (W.I.P)

A simple Ascii-graphics game engine that runs games off the terminal

The initial idea was to create a Battleships game (AsciiShips) with Ascii Graphics.
Then it sort of took off from there.


### Current Progress:

<ul>
  <li>Game Loop</li>
  <li>Input System (Mouse works only on some terminals)</li>
  <li>AscWindow System (Only Render window and Log window for now)</li>
  <li>Scene (Linked list of objects sorted in Z-order)
  <li>Entities
    <ul>
      <li>Basic Game Object</li>
      <li>Sprite</li>
      <li>Polygon</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ascii Line Rendering</li>
</ul>

I don't really know what more to add

### TODO:

<ul>
  <li>Logging system</li>
  <li>Make Battleships!</li>
</ul>
